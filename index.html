    <p>Happy Valentine’s Day to my favorite person 🫶
Not in a love story way, but in a you’re-my-forever-best-friend way.

Thank you for always checking on me,
for listening to my nonsense,
and for making even bad days feel lighter.

You’re my comfort person, my safe place, and my constant.
A little love, a lot of friendship, and endless memories 💫

No matter where life takes us,
you’ll always be special to me — today and always 🤍</p>

<p>On days when everything feels heavy, just thinking about you makes things easier. You have this beautiful way of making people feel safe and understood. I’m so lucky to have someone like you in my life — someone who listens, supports, and never gives up on me.</p>
